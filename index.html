        <article>
          <p>
            Welcome to my website, where I showcase my current projects and
            passions. My name is Jordan.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a recruitment professional with a decade of experience in the
            field, I have honed my skills in identifying top talent, building
            relationships with clients, and guiding candidates through the
            hiring process. My expertise in matching the right candidate with
            the right job has been invaluable to many organisations, and your
            dedication to your craft has allowed you to thrive in this industry.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite my success in recruitment, I have decided to pursue a new
            career path in front-end web development. This demonstrates my
            willingness to embrace change and my commitment to personal and
            professional growth. By taking a Front End Web Development course, I
            are gaining new skills and knowledge to enable me to transition to
            this exciting field.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to my pursuit of new skills, I have also taken up
            streaming on Twitch(when time allows me), which shows my willingness
            to experiment with new platforms and engage with audiences in
            creative ways. This not only demonstrates my ability to adapt to new
            technologies but also my passion for sharing my interests and
            knowledge with others.
          </p>
          <p>
            My experience in recruitment has undoubtedly given me a unique
            perspective on what employers look for in candidates, which will
            undoubtedly serve me well in my transition to web development. My
            ability to understand the needs of both employers and job seekers
            will make me an asset to any organisation I join, and my dedication
            to continuous learning will undoubtedly help me excel in this new
            field.

          <h3>Front End Web Development</h3>
          <p>
            I'm currently completing a 16-week Front End Development course. I'm
            excited to share with you what I've learned so far and the projects
            I'm working on (This being one of them). I believe I am passionate
            about web development and have been learning various technologies,
            such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm currently enrolled in a
            16-week Front End Development course where I'm building dynamic and
            responsive websites. I'm using my creativity to build websites that
            not only look beautiful but are also user-friendly. I'm excited
            about this course and the skills I'm gaining, and I look forward to
            applying them to future projects.
          </p>

          <h3>Streaming Persona - Nobdey92</h3>
          <p>
            I'm also working on restarting my streaming persona Nobdey92 on
            Twitch. I'm an avid gamer and a self-proclaimed gaming nerd. I enjoy
            playing a variety of games and sharing my gaming experiences with
            others. I'm passionate about creating an inclusive and positive
            gaming community where everyone can come together and have fun. My
            goal is to become the best gaming nerd there is and share my passion
            with the world.
          </p>
          <h3>In conclusion</h3>
          <p>
            I'm excited about the projects I'm currently working on and can't
            wait to see where they take me. I'm always open to new opportunities
            and collaborations, so feel free to reach out to me if you have any
            ideas or projects you'd like to work on together. Thank you for
            visiting my website, and I hope you enjoy exploring my projects and
            passions.
