        <h3>Front End Web Development</h3>
        <p>
          I'm currently completing a 16-week Front End Development course. I'm
          excited to share with you what I've learned so far and the projects
          I'm working on (This being one of them). I believe I am passionate
          about web development and have been learning various technologies,
          such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm currently enrolled in a
          16-week Front End Development course where I'm building dynamic and
          responsive websites. I'm using my creativity to build websites that
          not only look beautiful but are also user-friendly. I'm excited
          about this course and the skills I'm gaining, and I look forward to
          applying them to future projects.
        </p>
        <h3>Streaming Persona - Nobdey92 Twitch</h3>
        <p>
          I'm also working on restarting my streaming persona Nobdey92 on
          Twitch. I'm an avid gamer and a self-proclaimed gaming nerd. I enjoy
          playing a variety of games and sharing my gaming experiences with
          others. I'm passionate about creating an inclusive and positive
          gaming community where everyone can come together and have fun. My
          goal is to become the best gaming nerd there is and share my passion
          with the world.

        </h3>
        <p>
          I'm excited about the projects I'm currently working on and can't
          wait to see where they take me. I'm always open to new opportunities
          and collaborations, so feel free to reach out to me if you have any
          ideas or projects you'd like to work on together. Thank you for
          visiting my website, and I hope you enjoy exploring my projects and
