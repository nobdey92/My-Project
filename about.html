        <article>
            <p>
                Welcome to my website, where I showcase my current projects and
                passions. My name is Jordan.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a recruitment professional with a decade of experience in the
                field, I have honed my skills in identifying top talent, building
                relationships with clients, and guiding candidates through the
                hiring process. My expertise in matching the right candidate with
                the right job has been invaluable to many organisations, and your
                dedication to your craft has allowed you to thrive in this industry.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite my success in recruitment, I have decided to pursue a new
                career path in front-end web development. This demonstrates my
                willingness to embrace change and my commitment to personal and
                professional growth. By taking a Front End Web Development course, I
                are gaining new skills and knowledge to enable me to transition to
                this exciting field.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to my pursuit of new skills, I have also taken up
                streaming on Twitch(when time allows me), which shows my willingness
                to experiment with new platforms and engage with audiences in
                creative ways. This not only demonstrates my ability to adapt to new
                technologies but also my passion for sharing my interests and
                knowledge with others.
            </p>
            <p>
                My experience in recruitment has undoubtedly given me a unique
                perspective on what employers look for in candidates, which will
                undoubtedly serve me well in my transition to web development. My
                ability to understand the needs of both employers and job seekers
                will make me an asset to any organisation I join, and my dedication
                to continuous learning will undoubtedly help me excel in this new
                field.
